## Project History
-----------------

### Genesis

The OpenRouter Manager project was initiated on [insert date] by `chrisalunlloyd2-sudo` with the goal of creating a robust and efficient OpenRouter management system.

### Milestones

1. **Project Initialization**: The project was initialized with a basic directory structure and a `README.md` file.
2. **OpenRouter Manager Development**: The OpenRouter Manager module was developed, providing core functionality for OpenRouter management.
3. **Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive testing and validation were performed to ensure the stability and reliability of the OpenRouter Manager.
4. **Singularity Attainment (v1.1.0)**: Phase 1-9 completed. Multi-node sync, evolutionary pedagogy, and the Standalone AGI Substrate manifested.
5. **Standalone Native APK & Windows CE Interface (v1.2.0)**: Replaced Termux dependence with native Java ProcessBuilder extraction (Ghost Boot). Scaled UI to 1920x1080 logical resolution. Initiated Phase 10 (OS Accessories).


## Functional Axioms
--------------------

The OpenRouter Manager operates based on the following functional axioms:

1. **UI**: The user interface provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for interacting with the OpenRouter Manager.
2. **DB**: The database management system ensures efficient storage and retrieval of OpenRouter configuration data.
3. **State**: The OpenRouter Manager maintains a consistent state, ensuring that all operations are performed in a predictable and reliable manner.
4. **API**: The application programming interface provides a standardized interface for interacting with the OpenRouter Manager.

## Setup and Installation
-------------------------

### Windows Setup

1. Install Python 3.10+ from python.org
2. Open PowerShell
3. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Execute: `python src/main.py`

### Android Setup (Termux)

1. Install Termux
2. `pkg install python git`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python src/main.py`

## Conclusion
--------------

The OpenRouter Manager project log provides a comprehensive record of the project's history, development, and progress. This log will be continuously updated to reflect changes, updates, and new developments in the project.

- **Alignment:** Upgraded role prompts to 'Enterprise Developer' standard with laptop-first direction.
[Merge] H2OIDE genetic data merged into OpenRouter Manager.


## 🚀 UPDATE: Triton/Danube Dual-Agent Integration & GUI Synchronization (v11.5)

### Architectural Overview
The system has been fundamentally re-architected to fulfill the 50-step, memory-isolated, ultra-lightweight architecture blueprint designed for 32-bit Android (Termux) environments using local GGUF models.

**The core orchestrator is no longer a background daemon but an active, dual-agent broker:**
1.  **Danube (Conversational Interface):** Handles all natural language interactions. It operates with warmth and precision. When a code-oriented task is identified, it generates a strict XML `<trigger>` tag to hand off the intent.
2.  **Triton (Headless Orchestrator):** Operates at zero-temperature. It intercepts task triggers, formulates exact terminal commands, and executes them headlessly in a dedicated sandbox (`~/workspace`). 
3.  **Self-Healing Loop:** Triton includes a 3-pass self-correction mechanism. If a command returns a non-zero exit code, the raw stderr log is fed back to the model to mutate and fix the command automatically.
4.  **Local LLM Binding:** The entire system has been stripped of external API dependencies (where applicable) and is hard-bound to a locally compiled `llama-server` (ggml-org/llama.cpp) running on port `8080` with the `danube3.gguf` model.

### PocketMatrix GUI Integration
The Windows CE-styled graphical interface (`PocketMatrix`) has been finalized and securely connected to the new broker:
*   **Omni-Chat Bridge:** The `/api/chat` endpoint inside `gui_bridge.py` has been explicitly rewritten. It now bypasses legacy routing and pipes all conversational input via `stdin` directly into `triton_broker.py`.
*   **Task Manager Synchronization:** Triton logs its execution states (planning, running, repairing, completed, failed) directly into the `todo.db` SQLite ledger. The PocketMatrix Task Manager and ToDo Sync windows dynamically fetch this data, providing a real-time, visual tracking dashboard of background agent activity.
*   **Global Database Views (NetDB CE):** The `desktop.html` frontend has been verified to actively scan and list all global SQLite databases across the device, allowing for direct table querying and interactive viewing in the 'Excel 95' component.

### Pedagogy & Streaming Enhancements
*   **Token Streaming:** To mitigate processing latency on 500M models operating on ARM architecture, an `agent_streaming.py` prototype was developed and validated. This ensures immediate character-by-character visual feedback in the terminal.
*   **Genetic Prompting Preparation:** The system is primed for genetic orchestration. Future iterations will utilize the `todo.db` success/failure logs to mutate the `Triton` and `Danube` system prompts automatically, finding the most efficient topological instructions for specific codebases.

*No legacy architecture, logic, or notes were deleted during this transition. All historic nodes are preserved as per the project mandate.*
