[timedat: 2026-05-25 08:20:00]

## 🔬 EXPERIMENT 1: BRIDGING GEMINI CLI TO LOCAL SUBSTRATE
**Hypothesis:** By monitoring the `.gemini/tmp/home/chats/` directory, we can extract real-time TODOs and task them to the `H2OIDE` daemon for local execution.

**Scientific Method:**
1. **Observation:** Gemini CLI sessions are stored as JSONL logs in Termux.
2. **Experiment:** Manifest `TODO_SYPHON.py` to parse these logs.
3. **Validation:** Check if extracted tasks appear in `CHAT_SYPHON.md`.
4. **Rollback:** Automated git-restore on verification failure.

- **Hypothesis**: Testing Step 19 Integration
- **Result**: SUCCESS
- **Duration**: 0.05s

## [A/B TEST HYPOTHESIS: Phase 1 Java Payload Extraction]
**Objective:** Determine the most memory-efficient and reliable method for unpacking the static Linux (Termux-equivalent) binaries from the APK assets/ to the application data directory on a fenced (<512MB RAM) Android substrate.

**Variant A (Control):** ZipInputStream with a fixed 8KB byte buffer.
*   *Theory:* Standard Android method. Low memory overhead as it streams, but high CPU cyclic cost due to single-threaded inflation.

**Variant B (Experimental):** Tarball (.tar.gz) extraction using native GZIPInputStream pipelined to a custom Tar byte-reader.
*   *Theory:* GZIP handles compression better for thousands of small binary files (like Python standard libraries). May use slightly more RAM but reduce extraction time by 30%.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  Peak heap memory usage during extraction MUST stay below 32MB.
2.  Total extraction time < 15 seconds on an equivalent Cortex-A7 (32-bit) CPU.
3.  All resulting binaries successfully pass execution tests.

**Status:** Awaiting implementation of Variant A in Phase 1 codebase.

## [A/B TEST HYPOTHESIS: Phase 2 mmap Performance]
**Objective:** Compare Inference latency on 32-bit Android when using mmap (memory mapping) vs full RAM loading for a 400MB Q2 GGUF model.

**Variant A (mmap enabled):** llama-server --mmap
*   *Theory:* Allows the OS to handle paging. Should prevent OOM kills on 512MB RAM but might incur I/O latency on slow eMMC.

**Variant B (No mmap):** llama-server --no-mmap
*   *Theory:* Forces the entire model into active RAM. Likely to trigger Android Low Memory Killer (LMK) immediately on 32-bit fenced hardware.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  System stability: No process crashes during a 10-turn conversation.
2.  Inference speed: < 500ms per token (pref 2-3 tokens/sec on 32-bit).
3.  Memory Headroom: > 50MB free RAM reported by free -m during active inference.

**Status:** Implementation payload written. Awaiting execution in Phase 3.

## [A/B TEST HYPOTHESIS: Phase 3 SQLite WAL Performance]
**Objective:** Determine the impact of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) on UI responsiveness during concurrent AI training or logging writes on slow internal eMMC.

**Variant A (Delete Mode):** PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE;
*   *Theory:* Standard mode. AI writes should lock the database, causing the Windows CE UI (Taskbar, Excel Viewer) to hang or jitter during busy cycles.

**Variant B (WAL Mode):** PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
*   *Theory:* Allows concurrent readers and writers. The UI should remain fluid (Explorer navigation) even while the AI is streaming logs to the same database.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  UI Frame Stability: No Application Not Responding (ANR) warnings in the Android WebView.
2.  Write Throughput: > 50 records/sec during stress-test bursts.
3.  Concurrency: Zero Database is locked errors during simultaneous Chat and Excel View operations.

**Status:** Implementation payload written. Awaiting execution in Phase 4.

## [A/B TEST HYPOTHESIS: Phase 4 UI Rendering Latency]
**Objective:** Compare the frame-rate and input latency of the Windows CE UI when using CSS 'Filter' effects vs standard Hex-color borders on a 32-bit Android WebView.

**Variant A (Legacy Borders):** 2px outset/inset #FFF/#808080.
*   *Theory:* Uses standard box-model rendering. Should have 0ms overhead and maintain 60FPS even on old Gen 8 ARMv7 chips.

**Variant B (Advanced Filters):** CSS box-shadow and backdrop-filter to simulate depth.
*   *Theory:* Looks more 'modern-retro', but might cause the WebView thread to drop frames during background AI inference.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  Input Latency: < 10ms from click to window-focus change.
2.  Frame Stability: 60FPS during passive state.
3.  Thermal Impact: < 2°C rise in battery temperature during UI manipulation.

**Status:** Implementation payload written. Awaiting execution in Phase 5.

## [A/B TEST HYPOTHESIS: Phase 5 Agentic Entropy]
**Objective:** Measure the drift in agentic decision accuracy when running in a visual concurrent environment (Windows CE) vs a headless terminal environment.

**Variant A (Headless):** No GUI overhead. Pure CLI inference.
*   *Theory:* Maximum tokens/sec and highest focus. Baseline for accuracy.

**Variant B (Visual Omni):** Full GUI active + DB Explorer + Chat.
*   *Theory:* Context may be more fragmented due to system interrupts (ps, sqlite locks). Hypothesis is that accuracy remains >90% but latency may increase by 15%.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  Entropy Score: < 1.0 (Information gain maintained).
2.  System Uptime: > 24 hours of autonomous loop without crash.
3.  Accuracy: Agent completes 5 complex file-system tasks with 100% success.

**Status:** ALL PHASES COMPLETE. Finalizing System Handoff.

## [A/B TEST HYPOTHESIS: Phase 6 RAG Chunk Size]
**Objective:** Determine the optimal chunk size for semantic retrieval on small (500M parameter) models with limited context windows (2048 tokens).

**Variant A (Small Chunks):** 1024 characters (~256 tokens).
*   *Theory:* High granularity. Allows more unique chunks in the context window, but may lose semantic continuity of larger functions.

**Variant B (Large Chunks):** 4096 characters (~1024 tokens).
*   *Theory:* Better continuity. However, only 1-2 chunks can fit in the context window before displacing the system prompt and conversation history.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  Retrieval Recall: AI correctly identifies the specific file and line for a given technical query.
2.  Context Efficiency: Chunks do not exceed 25% of the total available context window.
3.  Indexing Speed: > 10 files per second on 32-bit eMMC.

**Status:** Phase 6.1 Indexer manifested. Awaiting benchmark results.

## [A/B TEST HYPOTHESIS: Phase 6.2 Search Prioritization]
**Objective:** Determine if Recency Weighting improves AI performance in active development tasks on 32-bit hardware.

**Variant A (Pure Semantic):** Simple ORDER BY cosine_similarity DESC.
*   *Theory:* Might retrieve old, stale code versions if they match keywords better.

**Variant B (Recency-Semantic Hybrid):** ORDER BY (similarity * 0.7) + (recency_score * 0.3) DESC.
*   *Theory:* Prioritizes the current In-Progress files you are working on, reducing hallucination of old logic.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  Context Relevance: AI accurately references the latest step in ZERO_TO_CE_500_STEPS.md.
2.  Response Accuracy: 100% success on "What was the last change I made?" query.
3.  Retrieval Latency: SQL calculation overhead < 50ms.

**Status:** Implementation in progress.

## [A/B TEST HYPOTHESIS: Phase 6.3 Source Attribution UI]
**Objective:** Measure the impact of visual citations on user trust and AI explainability on fenced 32-bit hardware.

**Variant A (Silent RAG):** AI uses context but does not cite sources.
*   *Theory:* Minimum character count. Faster token generation. User has no idea where the info came from.

**Variant B (Visible Citations):** AI appends a "Sources Used: [File X, File Y]" footer.
*   *Theory:* Increases explainability and trust. Minimal ( < 5%) overhead on token generation speed.

**Success Criteria:**
1.  Source Accuracy: 100% of cited files actually contain the information used.
2.  UI Responsiveness: Citation links in the chat window correctly focus and open the Knowledge Explorer.
3.  Memory Footprint: Metadata overhead in the SQLite query < 10KB per chat turn.

**Status:** Implementation in progress.
